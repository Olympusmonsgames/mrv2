v0.7.9
======

- Fixed sequence of images detection when there was an image with the same
  basename, directory and prefix but no number.
- Fixed the RAW image reader to handle images that are smaller once decoded.
- Fixed RAW reader not supporting LCMS2 nor jasper.  Now they are supported on
  all platforms.
- Added Sigma .X3F RAW support to RAW Reader.
- The RAW Reader properly reads all files but two from:
      https://www.rawsamples.ch
- Fixed an OpenGL refresh/redraw issue when going to the Preferences
  Window and returning with new settings.  It could also provoke a crash on
  Windows.
- Made the Log Panel not save its visibility upon program exit.  This prevents
  the Log Panel Window from opening on a new start up of mrv2 as it is usually
  not wanted, but happens once there had been an error in the previous instance.
- Linux uninstall with DEB and RPM has been improved.  Now, instead of just
  removing the symlink of /usr/bin/mrv2, the symlink is changed to point to the
  latest version installed if any.
- You can now open only one instance of the viewer and new images opened will
  be sent to the already opened viewer, instead of opening multiple instances
  of the viewer.  You set the behavior in:
  
	Preferences->User Interface->Single Instance.
	
- Removed all warnings and errors from the documentation generation.
- Fixed positioning of text editing when re-editing a text annotaion.
  Previously, it could be offset quite a bit if the zoom was not 1.
- A lot of source code clean up from mrViewer's bad and old source code.
- Windows installer now will remove the file association first before replacing
  it with the one of mrv2.

- Build system changes and fixes:

   * Renamed runme.sh script to runme_nolog.sh.
   * Added a new runme.sh script that calls runme_nolog.sh but saves the
     compile log into BUILD-KERNEL-ARCH/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE/compile.log.
   * Updated windows build script to work with MSVC 2022, not just 2019.
   * The windows compile takes advantage of Msys to install the dependencies
     of libintl, libiconv and gettext.
   * Made all compile options work when off.  You can customize mrv2 to
     build it with either all the bells and whistles or pretty barebones.
   * Added --help flag to runme.sh to list all the possible settings.
   * All bash commands are run with run_cmd which prints them and times them.
   * Added optional build support for all the optional TLRENDER_* settings and
     for the MRV2_* settings.  It is now possible to build a light version of
     mrv2 or one with all the features.
   * Fixed a problem with the embedded python (pybind11) locating the system
     python installation instead of the local one instead.  This created havok
     on my Ubuntu 22.04 when there was an upgrade.

======

- Added a hotkey selection to switch pen colors.
- Fixed hotkey search highlight redraw showing the wrong hotkey.

- Improved scripts in bin/ directory with help messages.
- Moved python scripts in bin/ directory to bin/python.
- Improved runme.sh script to accept a -gpl flag to compile FFmpeg with libx264

  FFmpeg.
- Fixed saving movies when saving without annotations leading to bad redraws
  later on in the timeline.

v0.7.5
======

Playlist and Editing
--------------------

This is the first version that supports some basic editing and improves upon
the playlist panel by making it interactive.

- The Playlist panel's functionality has been simplified. It is there only to
  create an empty track or start a new EDL with one clip from the Files Panel.
- Added an Edit/Frame/Cut, Edit/Frame/Copy, Edit/Frame/Paste and
  Edit/Frame/Insert to cut, copy, paste and insert one frame (video and audio)
  of any media.  Currently, it does not support transitions, that are removed.
  As soon as one of these commands is used, a new EDL is created.
- Added an Edit/Slice to cut a clip in half at the current time location.
- Added an Edit/Remove to remove the clips that intersect the current time
  location.
- Added Drag and Drop functionality to the Files Panel into the Timeline
  Window as well as to the Playlist panel to add clips and create an EDL.

- Fixed Undo/Redo of annotations, which was incorrect.
- Fixed keyboard (menu) shortcuts not working in the Files Panel.
- Annotations are now kept with RationalTime instead of frames to be more
  precise.  Note, however, that old session files that use annotations will be
  incompatible.

  as it was suggested using them in production was usually not the hassle.
- Fixed Image Information Panel size when it was saved as a window with the
  tabs open.
- Made Network connections more solid.  In case of wrong data sent through the
  network, it will discard it.

- Fixed incorrect use of OpenGL resources being shared with Secondary view
  leading to display issues.
- Made Secondary Window also display the name, type and audio of the
  video/image being played.
- Fixed Wayland and XWayland off-screen framebuffers.  Wayland support *must*
  be compiled with a recent Linux version like Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.  The binaries
  we distribute are compiled with a very old version of Wayland.
- Fixed a potential OpenGL redraw issue when drawing both soft and hard lines.
- Made draw cursor be a white/black shape for easier display.
- Fixed RPM package to install to /usr/local/mrv2-v${VERSION]-Linux-64 without library conflicts.  You can now install it just with something like:

```
  $ sudo rpm -i mrv2-v0.7.0-Linux-amd64.rpm
```

- Made Linux .deb and .rpm installers set the mrv2 desktop icon to Allow
  Launching by default.
- Made Linux .deb and .rpm installers set xdg-mime file associations properly
  for video, image, otio and USD files.

  adjustments).
- RPM and DEB packages have the version number in them to allow installing
  multiple versions of mrv2.  Besides /usr/bin/mrv2 pointing to the last
  installed version of mrv2, symlinks with the version number in them are
  also creaetd, like:
       /usr/bin/mrv2-v0.7.0
  

v0.6.4
------
- Improved Python plug-in API.  Now plug-ins are defined with a base class,
  and menus with a dict (without tuples) like:

```
      class HelloPlugin(mrv2.plugin.Plugin):
          def hello(self):
              print("Hello from plug-in!")

          def menus(self):
              menus = { "New Menu/Hello" : self.hello }
              return menus

  Help->Documentation.  The environment variable used to look up plug-ins is:

  	MRV2_PYTHON_PLUGINS

  It is a list of colon (Linux or macOS) or semi-colon (Windows) paths.
  Plug-ins are defined, like:

```
      class Plugin(mrv2.plugin.Plugin):
          def hello(self):
              print("Hello from plug-in!")

          def menus(self):
              menus = { "New Menu/Hello" : self.hello }
              return menus
```
     	

- Added a mrv2_hello.py plug-in for demo purposes.
- Fixed a bug in the log panel appearing compressed on start up when docked.
- Allowed creation of .otio files of a single clip in Playlist Panel.

- Added a ffmpeg_windows_gpl.sh script to compile a GPL version of FFmpeg with
  libx264 and libvpx suport with MSVC.
- Made mrv2's GL window swallow Left Alt key presses when pressed alone to
  avoid Windows' taking over the Window.
- Fixed some typos in English installer (thanks to BigRoy!).


v0.6.1
------
- Split the Save Session menu entry in two.  There's now a Save Session As and a
  Save Session.  The session filename is kept if the session file was loaded, so
  you can just use Save Session to overwrite it.
- Fixed creating of playlists with file sequences with absolute and relative
  paths.
- Fixed creating of playlists with different layers as it is not possible in
  .otio files to specify the layer to load.
- Fixed a refresh issue on color lookups that would show the previous frame
  values (or previous redraw values).

- Fixed PDF thumbnail creation when the clip was taller than its width.
- Fixed annotations not keeping the soft parameter in session or network
  connection.

v0.6.0
------
- Added the options for missing frames on the Preferences.  You can now:
  	* Display black
	* Repeat last frame
	* Repeat last frame scratched
	
- Made loading of session files use Path Mapping for files and OCIO config
  so that if a session file is loaded from different OSes the files will be
  found.
- Fixed loading session from the command-line not showing the opened panels that
  were also open in the preferences file.
- Added the name of the layer to the thumnail description in the files, compare,
  playlist and stereo panels.
- Added anaglyph, scanline, columns and checkered stereo 3D.
- Added a new Stereo 3D Panel to control the stereo.
   * To use it, you load a clip with left and right views (usually a v2
     multipart openexr).  Then, open the Files Panel and select the clip and
     layer to use.
   * Open the Stereo Panel and select the Input to "Image".  That will clone
     the clip and select the opposite view (ie. right if you selected left).
   * Choose the Output for the Stereo 3D (Anaglyph, Checkered, etc).

- You can also use the Stereo 3D Panel with two clips (movies or sequences),
  but you need to set it manually.
   * Open the Files Panel, load the two clips. Select one of them.
   * Open the Stereo 3D Panel, select the other clip.  Then select Input as
     "Image".
   * Choose the Output for the Stereo 3D (Anaglyph, Checkered, etc).

- Made File/Clone (Right Mouse Button on Files Panel clip) respect the frame
  and playback state of the original clip.
- Added a File/Refresh Cache (Right Mouse Button on Files Panel clip) to
  refresh the cache.  This is useful when viewing a partially rendered
  sequence.
- Made thumbnails in Files, Compare, Stereo 3D and Playlist panels show the
  actual layer (color channel).
- Made timeline thumbnail reflect the actual layer (color channel).
- Allowed saving annotations to a PDF.  Both picture thumbnails as well as
  text notes are saved.

------
- Made Playlist thumbnail reflect the current or in times.
- Changed extension of Session files to be .mrv2s to distinguish them from
  .m2s video/audio files.
- Fixed copying of colors from the Color Area Panel.
- Fixed refreshing of timeline when Close All was executed.
- Fixed sending and receiving notes through the network.
- Fixed saving of annotations in session files that were on the timeline.
- Fixed loading of annotations from a session file.
- Made clicking twice on area selection open/close the color area panel.
- Fixed annotations' ghosting which was not fading in/out correctly.
- Allowed loading a session file from the command-line.  Just do:

    $ mrv2 test.mrv2s

- Added accidentally missing licenses of Python and pybind11 to docs/Legal.
- Added a File/Clone right mouse button menu option to Files Panel.  This is
  useful when creating a playlist of the same element but different in/out
  points.

  files.
- Fixed macOS start-up script not passing the command-line arguments.
- Made session file store and restore the current time.


v0.5.3
------
- Made area selection allow it to select 1 pixel easier by a single click.
  To disable it, you just need to switch to a new action mode (drawing, etc).
- Some users on older macOS versions reported problems with the Privacy
  mechanism of the OS on Documents, Desktop and Download directories.
  The problem is not there if we use the native file chooser.  I've switched
  the default on macOS to use the native file chooser.
- Added a soft brush for annotations on all shapes.  You access it from the
  Annotation panel which can be opened from the menus or by clicking twice on
  any of the draw tools.  The algorithm for smooth brushes is not yet perfect,
  as it can lead to an overlapping triangle on self intersections.
- Allowed splatting a brush stroke if clicking only once.
- Made Pen size in annotations go as low as 2 pixels.  One pixel tends to
  vanish and have issues when panels are open.
- Added license and code attribution to the Polyline2D.h code which was missing

  without having to draw anything (or in addition to the drawn elements).
- Made view take the focus upon entering except when typing in the text tool.
- Fixed search in the Hotkey window which was missing the last character of
  the function.
- Fixed search repeatedly in the Hotkey window which was searching from the
  topline instead of from the last selected item.
- Allowed annotation drawing outside of the canvas once again.
- Fixed precision issues on annotation drawings.
- Made annotations respond to R, G, B, A channels changing.
- Removed ngrok documentation as it was incorrect for internet access.
- Fixed resizing of viewport not taking into account the status bar, leading
  to zoom factors of 1/1.04 instead of 1.

v0.5.2
------
- TCP Control Network port number is now saved in the preferences.
- Volume control is now saved in the preferences.
- Mute control is now saved in the preferences.
- Moved TCP volume and mute control to App.
- Fixed a bug in selection of items in Files Panel when two or more images
  had the same path.
- Fixed a bug in selection of items in Compare Panel which would show unselected
  files as selected.
- Added volume/setVolume to python cmds module.
- Added isMuted/setMute to python cmds module.

- Added -server, -client and -port command-line flags to start a network
  connection.
- Added documentation on how to establish a server-client connection on the
  internet using the free ngrok service.  This allows a single mrv2 server and
  a single mrv2 client to connect for free albeit for non-commercial projects.
  For multiple clients or commercial ventures, you need to pay for one of
  ngrok's plans or use another server of your choosing that will allow you to
  open a network port or remote ssh connection.
- Added parsing of hostname to extract tcp:// and :port from it.
- Upped the network protocol version used.  Now it is 2.  You can no longer
  use v0.5.1 with v0.5.2 or else the paths will get garbled.
- Fixed drawing and erasing of shapes getting drawn in different order.
- Annotations now can only be drawn inside the image instead of everywhere in
  the viewport.
- Fixed annotations ghosting not being drawn transparent in some areas and more
  solid in others.

v0.5.1
------
- Made Path Mappings get saved to a different file (mrv2.paths.prefs) instead
  of the main preferences file.
- Fixed a Windows input of accented (foreign) characters in Text tool.
- Fixed on Windows opening files with spaces on them when the language was
  not the same as the language of the OS.
- Improved the Save Options file requester with FFmpeg and OpenEXR options
  (not yet functional in tlRender).
- Made double clicking on any of the annotation tools in the action dock
  panel toggle the Annotation Panel.
- Added Send and Accept Media to send and receive media files opening,
  closing and syncing.

  is used does the drawing get reversed.
- Made cursor re-appear if drawing and using the right mouse button menu.
- Fixed saving of annotations in EXR images when they were big. 

v0.5.0
------
- Added networking to mrv2.  You can have a server and one or more clients and
  they will all colaborate with UI, pan and zoom, color transformations,
  playback, audio and annotations.  They can all be set to send or accept any
  item individually, from either the Preferences or the Sync menu.
  The server should contain the media to be reviewed.  Upon a connection by any
  client, the client will attempt to synchronize with the server.
  The sever and client are on a LAN and if both the client and server use the
  same paths to the media, the client will get all of its media loaded
  automatically.
  If they don't have the same paths, each file will be to the list of path
  mappings set in the Preferences.
  Finally, if that fails, the files will be compared on its base name
  and if matched, it will get accepted as the same clip, with a warning.
  If none of this is true, an error will appear, but the connection will
  continue.  However, syncing among multiple clips may show the wrong clip.
- Added Path Mapping to deal with paths being different on each platform, client
  or server.
- Fixed dragging of the timeline outside of the in-out range.  Now it will
  clamp the slider.
- Fixed a subtle bug in translations of Preferences' tree view which could lead
  to the wizard panel not show.
- Fixed a potential crash on log panel opening (when it was already opened).
- Fixed a bug on Windows and macOS that would size the panels beyond the bottom
  of the window.
- Added Environment Map options to python API.
- Fixed Luminance label spilling into the black areas of the pixel bar.
- Fixed Luminance tooltip flickering on macOS.
- Fixed Media Info Panel not showing up when the dockgroup was created for the
  first time.
- Fixed cursor disappearing on the action tool bar when a draw mode was
  selected.  Now it only disappears when it is in one of the views.
- Added saving of annotations when saving movie files or sequence of images.

- Due to changes in OpenColorIO, support for Windows 8.1 is no longer
  provided.
- Fixed Panel/Logs not showing as a toggle menu entry.
- We are also dropping support for 32-bit Windows machines, as it waa
  causing a lot of confusion with users downloading the wrong version
  from sourceforge.net when the amd64 (64-bits) version was not tagged as
  default or that it was called amd (and not Intel :)

  has no audio.
- Added number of Cache Ahead and Behind Video and Audio frames to HUD.
  If Ahead Video cache becomes 0 when playing forwards, playback will stop.
- Fixed Text tool input on Wayland.
- Removed libharfbuzz from the Linux distribution as it was causing trouble
  with some newer Linux distros.

  cgstudio config.
- Added Cut/Copy/Paste to Python editor (it was possible before, but just

       or by file media item.
     * Use libraries from the python standard library, except threads.

     The modules are:
     	 import mrv2
	 from mrv2 import cmd, math, imaging, media, timeline
