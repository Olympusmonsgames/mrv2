The Settings Panel (Default Hotkey: F9) allows you mainly to configure the Cache behavior of mrv2.  In it you can control how much memory in Gb does the cache use or, if you set the Gigabytes control to 0, instead of using Gigabytes, the Read Ahead and Read Behind settings will control the caching based on seconds.

The default Gigabytes setting is to use half of your available RAM.
