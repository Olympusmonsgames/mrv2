Preferences
###########

Preferences are changed by going to **Window->Preferences** (F10 by default).
The preferences of mrv2 are stored in your home directory, inside the .filmaura directory.  That is:

Linux::

  /home/<username>/.filmaura

macOS::

  /Users/<username>/.filmaura

Windows::

  C:/Users/<username>/.filmaura

There are several files.  The main preferences file that holds all the windows settings and user preferences is called::

  mrv2.prefs

The mrv2.prefs for the windows settings can usually be reset if you start mrv2 with -resetSettings or go to **Panel->Settings->Default** Settings.
  
The hotkeys file that holds all your keyboard shortcuts is called::

  mrv2.keys.prefs
  
The paths preferences file that holds old the path mappings is callled::

  mrv2.paths.prefs

The mrv2 file browser favorite directories is called::

  mrv2.favorites

It's important to know each file in case something does not work right or you wan to share the preferences between several different machines or users (you can usually copy each file or the whole .filmaura folder).

User Interface
==============

.. image:: ./images/preferences-01.png
   :align: center
	   
Here is where you can set the preferences of the User Interface when starting mrv2.
The Window Behavior section allows you to set how the main and secondary window behave.

.. topic:: Always on Top and Secondary On Top

   This setting sets the behavior of the main and secondary windows to always remain on top of other windows on the system.

.. topic:: Single Instance

	   When selected, mrv2 will behave as a single instance.  If you open
	   other movies with another mrv2, these will be redirected to the
	   single instance of mrv2.  Note that you can toggle this setting at
	   any time in the preferences to switch the behavior of mrv2.

	   This works with a TCP port in 55120, so if you are on Windows, it may
	   bring up a popup for allowing the connection to go through the
	   Firewall.  On Linux or macOS, this is not necessary.
	   

.. topic:: Auto Refit Image

	   When this is on, any rescaling of the window will reposition and center the image withing the viewport.

.. topic:: Normal, Fullscreen and Presentation

	   With this setting, it allows mrv2 to start at the size of the loaded image (Normal), at Fullscreen or in Presentation mode.

UI Elements
+++++++++++

.. topic:: The UI bars
   
	   These allow you to start mrv2 without one of its toolbars.

	   It allows you to use menus in the macOS bar instead of mrv2's menu bar (Setting for macOS only).

.. topic:: Version Regex

	   mrv2 supports image and movie versioning by using a regular expression (regex).  The default is to use _v which will match any text that starts with _v and a number.  When a version is matched and a Next, Previous, First or Last version is searched, the regex matching is printed out to the terminal.

Path Mapping allows you to share images and movies on a network even when the drive and paths do not match.  In the example above, the Remote directory is /Users/gga (a macOS directory), that is mapped to /home/gga (a Unix one).

The path mapping paths are saved in a simple text file in your .filmaura home directory, as mrv2.paths.prefs.
