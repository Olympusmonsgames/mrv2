   This widget was designed to add the functionality of compressing and
   aligning widgets.
   <P>If type() is Pack::HORIZONTAL all the children are
   resized to the height of the Pack, and are moved next to
   each other horizontally. If type() is not Pack::HORIZONTAL
   then the children are resized to the width and are stacked below each
   other.  Then the Pack resizes itself to surround the child
   widgets.
   <P>This widget is needed for the Fl_Tabs.
   In addition you may want to put the Pack inside an
   Fl_Scroll.

   <P>The resizable for Pack is set to NULL by default.</p>
