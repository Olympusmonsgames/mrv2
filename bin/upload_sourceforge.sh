## Notes on installation

- On macOS you install it by opening the .dmg file, and dragging the mrv2
  icon to the Applications directory.  If there's already an mrv2 version,
  we recommend you overwrite it.
  The macOS application is currently not notarized, so when you launch it you
  will not be able to run it as macOS will warn you that the file is not secure
  as it was downloaded from internet.
  To avoid that, you need to open the Finder, go to the Applications directory
  and CTRL + Left mouse click on the mrv2 application.  That will bring up
  the same warning, but this time it will have a button that will allow you
  to open it.  You only need to do this once.

- Windows and Chrome, like macOS, also protect you from installing files
  from the Internet.  When you first download it with Chrome it may warn
  you that it is not an usual archive to be downloaded.  Make sure to click
  on the right up arrow menu to Save it anyway.
  You cannot open the .exe from Chrome directly.  You will need to open
  Windows Explorer and go to the Downloads directory.  You should then
  run it from there.
  Then Windows will popup a Blue box telling you Windows SmartScreen
  prevented the start of an unknown aplication and that you can place your
  PC at risk.
  Click on the More Information text and a Button that says Run anyway or
  similar should appear.  Click on it and follow the standard instructions
  to any Windows installer.


- On Linux, in order to install the .rpm or .deb packages requires your user to
  have sudo permissions.

  On Debian (Ubuntu, etc) systems, you would install with:

```
  sudo dpkg -i mrv2-beta-Linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

  On Red Hat (Rocky Linux, etc), you would install it with:
  
```
  sudo rpm -i mrv2-beta-Linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

  Once you install it, you can run mrv2 by just typing mrv2 in the shell, as
  a symlink to the executable is placed in /usr/bin.  The installers will also
  associate file extensions and install an icon for easy starting up in the
  Desktop icon of the user that installed it.  For running mrv2 with the icon,
  you need to select it and use the right mouse button to open the menu and
  choose Allow Launch.
  
  If you lack sudo permissions in your organization, you should download the
  .tar.gz file and you can uncompress it with:
  
```
  tar -xf mrv2-beta-Linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

  That will create a folder in the direcory you uncompress it from.  You can
  then run mrv2 by using the mrv2.sh shell script in the bin/ subdirectory.
