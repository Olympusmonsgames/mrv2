mrv2 v1.1.5
========

mrv2 is an open source professional player and review tool for vfx, animation and computer graphics for Windows, Linux and macOS.

This is a critical update for Windows and more importantly Linux users.
It is a bug fix release for the regressions in v1.1.4 which was rushed:

- Added a FAQ on the documentation about Linux XWayland and Wayland on
  why it could make playback slow if your OS was not configured properly.
- This is the first version that supports Wayland and XWayland.
  For instructions on how to set XWayland and Wayland on Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS
  with NVidia drivers, please see Help->Documentation the FAQ section.
- Fixed annotations not showing when Blit Viewports was on.
- Fixed hiding of pixel bar sometimes failing even when:
      Playback->Auto Hide Pixel Bar
  and:
      Playback->Auto Playback was on.
- Fixed not hiding of the pixel bar when the image was open from the
  recent menus or from the command-line.
- Fixed color buffers not taking full advantage of OpenGL improvements on
  Windows mainly.
- Fixed incorrect positioning and resizing of the images on loading
  which would crash Wayland.
- mrv2 can now be built with the pre-installed python, without having to
  build python itself.  Of course, in that case, mrv2 cannot be re-distributed.
  Tested on Linux only for now.
- Added a python translating system for plug-ins.
- Translated all update-mrv2.py strings into Spanish.
