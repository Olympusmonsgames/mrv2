mrv2 v1.0.7
===========
- Code clean up.
- Faster windows minimal compilations for quickly checking on GitHub.
- Added optional component installation on Windows's .exe installer.  Currently,
  you can install:
  
      * mrv2 application (obviously)
      * mrv2 documentation
      * mrv2 Python demos
      * mrv2 Python libraries
      * mrv2 USD components

   If you choose to install ONLY the application, its size is 395Mb, instead
   of the whole 600Mb.

- Changed name of install directory of mrv2 on Windows from "mrv2 vX.X.X" to
  "mrv2-vX.X.X" to avoid spaces for easier scripting.
- Fixed image sequence detection that could fail randomly depending on how
  the filesystem returned the order of files.
- Added listing the OS and distro versions at the start and in About of mrv2
  for debugging purposes.
- Made panels be listed alphabetically, regardless of Natural Language.

- Cleaned up docs directory before building docs.
- Sped up creation of docs in build system.
- Updated Python API with FFmpeg and Background changes.
- Fixed reading permissions on files as they were broken!  I did not notice
  as I was using an NTFS drive which sets umask 0022 by default.
- Made reading session more robust to handle missing files or wrong settings.
- Made checking for readable files faster.
- Fixed saving large images/movies with annotations on work properly.
- Improved memory consumption of saving movies, particularly large ones like
  4K.
- Improved logging system logging the tlRender warnings.
- Improved logging system adding a Status mode to report information right
  away.

  viewport.

- Fixed image panel not refreshing its information when changing images and
  the playback was stopped.
- Fixed Preferences->Positioning->Position/Size when both were used.
- Saving of .otio files as movies when the first clip did not start at 0 now
  works properly.
- Upgraded to RtAudio v5.2.0 on all platforms.
- Added a View/Auto Frame to turn off auto framing of the view when changing
  from one clip to another.
