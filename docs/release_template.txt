mrv2 v1.1.8
=========

mrv2 is an open source professional player and review tool for vfx, animation and computer graphics for Windows, Linux and macOS.

This is a bug fix update and feature update.  mrv2's v1.1.7 fix for YUV420P_U8 movies with "unknown" color space took a hit on performance and could make decoding of such movies at 2K stall, so now a new feature to turn it off has been added to the Performance settings of the Settings Panel.  The default is for quality
at the expense of performance.
Window resizing code has been dramatically improved, taking only the screen
space needed for the size of your movie.
Window's Fixed Size and Fixed Position have also been fixed.
Preferences->Audio has been added to allow you to select different audio
devices and, on Linux, different APIs.
Added the ability to load single frames from both the menus or from the
command-line.
The "About->Update mrv2" python plug-in has been further improved.
