mrv2 v1.0.7
===========

- Slow code clean up.
- Faster windows minimal compilations for quickly checking on GitHub.
- Added optional component installation on Windows's .exe installer.  Currently,
  you can install:
  
      * mrv2 application (obviously)
      * mrv2 documentation
      * mrv2 Python demos
      * mrv2 Python libraries
      * mrv2 USD components

   If you choose to install ONLY the application, its size is 395Mb, instead
   of the whole 600Mb.

- Changed name of install directory of mrv2 on Windows from "mrv2 vX.X.X" to
  "mrv2-vX.X.X" to avoid spaces for easier scripting.
- Fixed image sequence detection that could happen randomly depending on how
  the filesystem returned the order of files.
- Added listing the OS and distro versions at the start and in About of mrv2
  for debugging purposes.
- Made panels be listed alphabetically, regardless of Natural Language.
- Automated version update in docs.
- Removed view sources from html docs to save space on disk.
- Cleaned up docs directory before building docs.
- Sped up creation of docs in build system.
- Updated Python API with FFmpeg and Background changes.
- Fixed reading permissions on files as they were broken!  I did not notice
  as I was using an NTFS drive which sets umask 0022 by default.
- Made reading session more robust to handle missing files or wrong settings.
- Made checking for readable files faster.
- Fixed saving large images/movies with annotations on work properly.
- Improved memory consumption of saving movies, particularly large ones like
  4K.
- Improved logging system logging the tlRender warnings.
- Improved logging system adding a Status mode to report information right
  away.
- FFmpeg's logging now prints out the codec/module where the error was
  generated.
- Improved movie save reporting of parameters.
- Fixed saving a movie with annotations when the movie is bigger than the
  viewport.
- Added GBR8/9/10/12 reading support for VPX.
- Fixed start and end timeline buttons not refreshing thumbnails in the Panels.
- Fixed image panel not refreshing its information when changing images and
  the playback was stopped.
- Fixed Preferences->Positioning->Position/Size when both were used.
- Saving of .otio files as movies when the first clip did not start at 0 now
  works properly.
- Upgraded to RtAudio v5.2.0 on all platforms.
- Added a "View/Auto Frame" to turn off auto framing of the view when changing
  from one clip to another.
- Added User Interface->View->Auto Frame to preferences. 
- Made saving a VP9 or AV1 with the wrong extension not fail.  Instead, they
  are renamed to .mp4 and a warning is sent to the logs.
- Made mrv2's file requester favorites listing automatically remove
  non-existent directories.
- When saving a sequence of OpenEXR, we encode the speed in the actual
  image file, as taken from the playback tool bar.  This value will take
  precedence over the Sequence Default speed as set in Preferences->Playback.
