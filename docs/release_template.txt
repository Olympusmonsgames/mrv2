mrv2 v1.0.6
===========

mrv2 is an open source professional player and review tool for vfx, animation and computer graphics for Windows, Linux and macOS.

In v1.0.6, we have several important fixes to the new save dialog.  Minor fixes in tlRender and a more user friendly Save Image / Save Movie dialog box.

- Darby fixed Render->Alpha Blend modes which were partially broken.
- Darby fixed macOS checkers drawing.
- Darby added gradient background and moved it to draw video.
- Made Background colors use Flmm's color chooser with alpha (alpha is
  current discarded, thou).
- Added printing out of audio and video codec names when saving with FFmpeg.
- Fixed presets names.  Instead of using '_' we now use '-'.
- Added last successful saved movie to recent files for easy checking it back.
- Fixed pixel format selection in VP9 codec not working properly due to
  profile being set to 0, which would prevent saving with 10 or 12 bits.
- Fixed Prores color shifting due to bad unneeded use of libswscale API.
- Added options for color_range, colorspace, color_primaries and color_trc in
  tlRender's source code.  mrv2 currently does not yet use them.
- Made mrv2 remember the save movie and image settings for easy saving of
  multiple movie or image files.
- Added a pre-flight check to macOS native Apple Prores encoder. 
- Made FFmpeg errors be reported to the console immediately.
