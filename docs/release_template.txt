mrv2 v1.1.1
========

mrv2 is an open source professional player and review tool for vfx, animation and computer graphics for Windows, Linux and macOS.

mrv2 now supports multiple audio tracks in movies, just like mrViewer.  You can change tracks from the speaker icon with the Right Mouse Button.
Movies longer than 30 minutes now use a more limited cache, as switching
audio tracks for them would take too long otherwise.
In addtion, there's numerous speed improvements and bug fixes to the Media Information Panel, a serious bug fix when saving movies with Annotations on Linux, improvements to the Python Panel and its error reporting.
The main web page of mrv2 has also received a minor facelift to make it
readable at different resolutions.
