If you are coming from mrViewer 1 (ie. v6.2.3), here's the stuff that
mrv2 is still missing:

- Frame stepping with Audio.
- Playback of 5:1 and 7:1 audio.
- Multiple audio tracks.
- Subtitles (both embedded and coming from an .srt file).
- Translations of the UI to different languages.
- RED3D and Blackmagic RAW support.

There are other features that have been deprecated and will *NOT* come back:

- CTL and ICC support
- ACESClip and AMF support
- Reading of mental ray stub files
