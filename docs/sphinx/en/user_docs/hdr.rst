HDR
###

mrv2 supports HDR internally but currently cannot display it on an HDR monitor or TV set, as it is a limitation of OpenGL.

What can be done is to use an output SDK + output device connected to an external monitor or use NDI® Tools if using NDI®.


NDI®
----

NDI® uses your local LAN to transmit the video through and can be used for reviewing content among artists.  Currently, the Normal NDI SDK is limited to 8-bits, not HDR.  We are waiting on confirmation whether the Advanced NDI SDK can be distibuted freely.

If you want to view NDI® with full HDR on a computer monitor, you can use the NDI Tools (macOS or Windows only), which can be downloaded from:
