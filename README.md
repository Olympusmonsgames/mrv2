# Pre-built binaries

If you are looking for pre-built binaries for Windows, Linux or macOS (Intel), they can be found in:

[GitHub](https://github.com/ggarra13/mrv2/releases)

or in its mirror site at:

[SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mrv2/files/)

The source forge site also hosts beta builds (nightly builds with the latest changes).

## Compatibility

mrv2 binaries run on Windows 8.1+, RedHat 8.1+ or Ubuntu 20.04+ and macOS 11.0+.

## Notes on installation

- On macOS you install it by opening the .dmg file, and dragging the mrv2
  icon to the Applications directory.  If there's already an mrv2 version,
  we recommend you overwrite it.
  The macOS application is currently not notarized, so when you launch it you
  will not be able to run it as macOS will warn you that the file is not secure
  as it was downloaded from internet.
  To avoid that, you need to open the Finder, go to the Applications directory
  and CTRL + Left mouse click on the mrv2 application.  That will bring up
  the same warning, but this time it will have a button that will allow you
  to open it.  You only need to do this once.

- Windows and Chrome, like macOS, also protect you from installing files
  from the Internet.  When you first download it with Chrome it may warn
  you that it is not an usual archive to be downloaded.  Make sure to click
  on the right up arrow menu to Save it anyway.
  You cannot open the .exe from Chrome directly.  You will need to open
  Windows Explorer and go to the Downloads directory.  You should then
  run it from there.
  Then Windows will popup a Blue box telling you Windows SmartScreen
  prevented the start of an unknown aplication and that you can place your
  PC at risk.
  Click on the More Information text and a Button that says Run anyway or
  similar should appear.  Click on it and follow the standard instructions
  to any Windows installer.


- On Linux, in order to install the .rpm or .deb packages requires your user to
  have sudo permissions.

  On Debian (Ubuntu, etc) systems, you would install with:

```
  sudo dpkg -i mrv2-v0.7.8-Linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

  On Red Hat (Rocky Linux, etc), you would install it with:
  
```
  sudo rpm -i mrv2-v0.7.8-Linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

  Once you install it, you can run mrv2 by just typing mrv2 in the shell, as
  a symlink to the executable is placed in /usr/bin.  The installers will also
  associate file extensions and install an icon for easy starting up in the
  Desktop icon of the user that installed it.  For running mrv2 with the icon,
  you need to select it and use the right mouse button to open the menu and
  choose Allow Launch.
  
  If you lack sudo permissions in your organization, you should download the
  .tar.gz file and you can uncompress it with:
  
```
  tar -xf mrv2-v0.7.8-Linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

  That will create a folder in the direcory you uncompress it from.  You can
  then run mrv2 by using the mrv2.sh shell script in the bin/ subdirectory.

# Features

The source code is written in C++17 and uses CMake for the build system, with some bash scripts for auxiliary tasks.

- Stereo 3D (Anaglyph, Scanlines, Columns, Checkered, Side by Side)
- PDF Exporting of Annotations and Notes

# Building

## Building with Docker

On Linux, if you have Docker installed with your user as part of the docker
group, you can just build mrv2 with:

```
./runme_docker.sh
```
The resulting installers will be placed in a new packages/ directory of the
root of mrv2.  The docker images are compatible with RedHat 8.1 and Ubuntu 20.04.

### Windows

- [Visual Studio 2019 or later Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/en/free-developer-offers)
- [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [CMake 3.26.2 or later](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [NSIS Installer for Packaging](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download) - Optional

Additional dependencies are downloaded and built automatically by the CMake
superbuild script.  For a list of non-system libraries that mrv2 depends on
and their licenses, please refer to mrv2/docs/Legal.
The system dependencies for each OS is listed below.

The only special requirement is installing a new copy of cmake than the
one that ships with MSVC19.
If building the NSIS installer, you need to place the root of mrv2 in a path
that has less than 20 characters, like:

```
     /D/code/applications
```



## Building mrv2

Clone the repository:
```
cd some_dir

#
# Clone the latest cutting-edge build (might be unstable).
#
git clone https://github.com/ggarra13/mrv2.git

cd mrv2
./runme.sh
```

The script is a superbuild script that will download all needed dependencies
required.  It will create a build and a:
```
BUILD-KERNEL-ARCH/BUILDTYPE/install
````
directory where all files shall reside.  

Make sure you meet the basic dependencies for your platform.  See [Dependencies](#dependencies).

The runme.sh sript will output its progress to the terminal and also save itt
in:
````
BUILD-KERNEL-ARCH/BUILDTYPE/compile.log.
````
The default is to build with all cores in all the Operating Systems.
If you want more or less cores pass another number to any of
the runme*.sh scripts.  For example, to build with 4 cores, you can do:

```
./runme.sh -j 4
```


Later, if you just want to build mrv2 quickly (runme quick mnemonic)
without running through all the dependencies, run:

```
./runmeq.sh
```

Later, to just build FLTK, tlRender and mrv2  (runme three mnemonic), run;

```
./runmet.sh
```

## Debug builds


All runme.sh scripts support two additional parameters.
For a debug build, you would do:

```
./runme.sh debug
```

To clean up the directory, run a debug build with 8 cores, run:

```
./runme.sh clean debug -j 8
```



## Building on Windows

For windows, in addition to Visual Studio, you will need a new and
fresh copy of Msys.
There is a .bat file included in the distribution (in windows/bat),
which needs to be modified to the path of Visual Studio (2019 by default),
the optional Windows SDK (none by default) and your copy of Msys.

As a convernience for Windows users, DLLs, includes and .lib files
for FFmpeg and liblcms2 libraries are provided in mrv2's windows/win64 directory.  The libintl and libiconv libraries are taken from the MSys64 repositories as pre-flight check with the bin/install_libintl_window.sh script (part of runme.sh).

If you unset LCMS2_ROOT in windows/envvars/envvars.sh, the library will be compiled.

## CMake build options

The main runme.sh script supports passing CMake flags to it and allows turning on or off some options of mrv2.  You must pass them like:

-D TLRENDER_USD=OFF

Currently, the flags supported are:

| Name              | Description                                       | Default   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| BUILD_FLTK        | Toggles FLTK building (currently needed)          | TRUE      |
| BUILD_PYTHON      | Toggles Python building or system installed.      | TRUE      |
| MRV2_PYBIND11     | Toggles Python support in mrv2.                   | TRUE      |
| MRV2_NETWORK      | Toggles Network and Single Instance.              | TRUE      |
| MRV2_PDF          | Toggles PDF Saving and Creation.                  | TRUE      |
| TLRENDER_USD      | Toggles support for USD                           | TRUE      |
| TLRENDER_RAW      | Toggles support for RAW Camera formats            | TRUE      |

## Building FFmpeg as GPL or LGPL

If you pass -gpl or -lpgl to the runme.sh script, like:

```
./runme.sh -gpl
```

The build system will compile FFmpeg as GPL or LGPL on all platforms.  The default is to build a LGPL version of FFmpeg as that complies with the BSD binary distribution license.  The LGPL version of FFmpeg, however, does not come with libx264, which means you cannot save movie files with the H264 codec.  On Windows, if you don't specify neither -gpl nor -lgpl, the pre-compiled LGPL binaries are used.

The GPL version of FFmpeg does not have that restriction and it will compile libx264 on all platforms.

# Running mrv2

## macOS and Linux

If you have a bin directory in your $HOME (ie. ~/bin ), the build scripts will
create a symlink there.  So you should add ~/bin to your PATH in your .bashrc
or .zshrc.

Assuming you complied mrv2 with the ~/bin directory already created, then to
start mrv2 then you'd do:

```
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH  # no need if you add this line to your .bashrc
mrv2
```

and to run the debug build.

```
export PATH=~/bin:$PATH  # no need if you add this line to your .bashrc
mrv2-dbg
```

If you compiled mrv2 without bin directory in your HOME directory, you can
start it from the BUILD directory with the mrv2.sh script, like:

```
BUILD-Linux-amd64/Release/install/bin/mrv2.sh
```

## Windows

On Windows, we cannot create symbolic links, so in Msys you need to type the whole path to the install.  That is, for example:


```
BUILD-Msys-amd64/Release/install/bin/mrv2.exe
```

If you like to work command line, you should add the whole path to the mrv2.exe to your path.  In Msys, you can add it to the .bashrc like shown on macOS and Linux.

For cmd.exe or PowerShell, on the Windows taskbar, right-click the Windows icon and select System. In the Settings window, under Related Settings, click Advanced system settings. On the Advanced tab, click Environment Variables. Find the PATH environment variable and add the full path to mrv2.exe.

For working with a GUI, after the build is done, you should do:

```
cd BUILD-Msys-amd64/Release/install/bin/  # or similar
explorer .
```

And in the explorer directory that it will open, you should create a shortcut
with the RMB to the mrv2.exe.  Once that is done, you can drag and rename the
shortcut to your Desktop to have it handy.
Note that if you will not be developing mrv2, you should instead proceed to [Packaging](#packaging).

# Tutorials

Besides the basic API documentation included, there is a special channel on youtube.com where you can
find some tutorials on its basic use:

[Video Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JViz-pPCrg&list=PLxJ9NNBdNfRmd8AQ41AJYmb7WhN99G5C-)

# Documenting

Currently, the documentation is generated automatically from the translations.
To do so, you must run:

```
./runmeq.sh -t doc
```

# Translating

mrv2 can support multiple natural language translations.  Currently, English
and Spanish are supported.  The translation system used is gettext so
familiarity with it is desired (albeit not essential).
The translations reside in mrv2/po and follow internationalization language
code files, like es.po (for Spanish) or de.po (for German).

To create such a file for a new language, open the file
cmake/translations.cmake
and add a language international code to this line:

```
set( LANGUAGES es ) # add a new language code inside the parenthesis, like "de".
```

Then, run:

```
./runmeq.sh -t po
```

If there's no .po file for that language yet, gettext's msginit command
will be run for you.  You may be asked for your email address as part of
the process.

Go to mrv2/po/{lang}.po where lang is the language you added.

and edit the text.  Make sure to change the charset to UTF-8.

Note that you should use an editor that can write in Unicode (UTF-8) to
write non-Occidental languages.

You need to edit "msgstr" strings and leave "msgid" untouched as a reference.
If the comment has a "fuzzy" string it means gettext tried to guess the
translation, but it will not use it.  Remove the fuzzy qualifier and change the
"msgstr" string.  Note that if the "msgid" has new-lines you need to match them
too.  Refer to the gettext manual for further information.

Once you are ready to test your translation, run:

```
./runmeq.sh -t mo
```

That will create the .mo files for your language. 

## If you compiled mrv2

To test the translation, you can just run:

```
./runmeq.sh -t install
```

or just:

```
./runmeq.sh
```

and that will place the .mo files in the:
$BUILD-$OS-$ARCH/$BUILD_TYPE/install/share/locale directory.

If you add or remove strings as part of your code changes, you may want to
regenerate the .pot files after a while, before calling -t mo.  To do so:

```
./runmeq.sh -t pot
```

Note that this change is dramatic as your commits of the code changes will
get mangled with all the .pot/.po comments, preventing a clean PR
(Pull Request) on github.com.

## If you did not compile mrv2

Manually copy the .mo to your installed mrv2 directory.  Make sure the VERSION matches.

```
cp mrv2/share/locale/${lang}/LC_MESSAGES/mrv2-v${VERSION}.mo ${installed_location of mrv2)/hare/locale/${lang}/LC_MESSAGES/
```


## Translating on Windows

On Windows, besides the text of mrv2, you also need to translate the text for
the NSIS .exe installer.

You can do it by editing the cmake/nsis/mrv2_translations.nsh file.
Just follow the examples in that file.

# Packaging

Once you build mrv2 and tested that it runs, you might want to create a package
for distribution.  On macOS, this is a .dmg file.  On Linux it is a RPM, DEB or
TGZ file.  On Windows it is a ZIP or an NSIS EXE installer.

To do so, from the main dir of mrv2, you have to do:

```
./runmeq.sh -t package
```
For all architectures, the installers will be stored in:

```
packages/
```

That is the root directory of mrv2.

# Developing

If you want to become a developer, first familiarize yourself with the build process.  Then clone the repository to your github account and send PRs.  If you become an avid developer, you can then request access to the main repository.

One additional thing that you will need for making commits to the repository, is:

```
clang-format
```

This is part of the LLVM project, you can download it from your usual repositories (apt, brew, etc.), or from:

[LLVM Main Download Page](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html)

This utility verifies previous to a commit that all the C++ formatting follows the standard used in mrv2.

You might also want to get Doxygen so as to get the source code documentation in docs/Doxygen.
